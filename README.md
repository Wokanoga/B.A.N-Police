#B.A.N Police

2.3.20: This is a side project for the encouraged automation of the Google IT Automation Python Professional Certificate.  I plan on this to be a discord bot that when running will continuously send a selected user to the afk channel in my discord server if they are not in it.

2.3.20: Lots of old guides outdated.  Among them send_message being outdated and mostly replaced by message.channel.send or user.send.  Fuckloads of events to play with.  Getting a specific user id to send private messages was very straight- forward.  In fact everything seems pretty straight-forward so far.  I hope there is a event to detect a specific user id entering specific channel ids.  Pycharm is godlike I don't know why I haven't tried this before.
